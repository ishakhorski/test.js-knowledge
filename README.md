# Frontend Developer Assesment

Please spend no more than a couple hours working through the problems below. Return code back to us in
whatever way is most convenient for you.


## 1. Watching an Object

Using TypeScript or vanilla Javascript (no 3rd party libraries/packages allowed), create a `watch()` function with
the following signature:

```
watch(
    obj: Object
    getCallback: Function(key, value) | undefined
    setCallback: Function(key, value) | undefined
)
```

The returned value should allow inspection & mutation of `obj` , and will:
- call (if available) any time an existing property on obj is accessed.
- call (if available) any time a property is set or updated on the underlying object.

An example of its usage/behavior might look something like this:
```
const obj = {};

const watchedObj = watch(
    obj,
    (key, value) => console.log('property accessed: ', key),
    (key, value) => console.log('property modified: ', key, value)
)

watchedObj.foo; => // no watch called, property doesn't exist
watchedObj.foo = true; => property set: foo
watchedObj.foo; => property accessed: foo
```

## 2. TypeScript Type Definition

Given a TypeScript interface that defines an existing Post from an API:
```
interface post {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    content: string | null;
}
```

Define a type `NewPost` based off of this Post interface which makes id optional. We're looking for a type that
utilizes the Post above to effectively create NewPost as shown below:
```
interface NewPost {
    id?: number;
    title: string;
    content: string | null;
}
```

In short, complete the definition:
```
type NewPost = ....
```

## 3. JSON Manipulation

Using the attached `products.json` file as source input, please provide code to answer each of these questions
as succinctly as possible.

    1. Which products are out of stock, `not` on sale, and under $20?
    2. What is the most commonly used category?
    3. What is the average price of sale items?
    4. How many womenâ€™s products are out of stock, broken down by color?
